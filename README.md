# fusion_block

Hi,

I am glade you find this .



For using, pls config all parameters in hyper_and_conf/hyper_parameter.py  and other configurations can be find in main.py and core_model_initializer.py.

For TFRecord generating, pls check tfrecord_generator_1.py

Last, but the most exiting thing is to run main.py!

Welcome to debug and fork


I like you guys.
